## Installation

Grazier can easily be installed using pip:
```bash
pip install grazier
```

Each of the LLMs may need additional setup, which you can find in the engine setup section below.


## Usage

For completion engines, it's as simple as:
```python
import grazier

grazier.list_models()
['gptj-6B', 'gpt2', 'gpt2-med', 'gpt2-lg', 'gpt2-xl', 'distilgpt2', 'gptneo-125M', 'gptneo-1.3B', 'gptneo-2.7B', 'stablelm-3B', 'stablelm-7B', 'opt-125M', 'opt-350M', 'opt-1.3b', 'opt-2.7b', 'opt-6.7b', 'opt-13b', 'opt-30b', 'opt-66b', 'llama-7B', 'llama-13B', 'llama-30B', 'llama-65B', 'gpt3-davinci3', 'gpt3-davinci2', 'gpt3-curie', 'gpt3-babbage', 'gpt3-ada', 'palm']
gpt2 = grazier.get("gpt2")
completion = gpt2("I enjoy walking with my cute dog, but sometimes he gets scared and")
print(completion)
```

For chat engines, all you need to do is add the `type="chat"` parameter:
```python
from grazier import Conversation, Speaker, get, list_models

conversation = Conversation()
conversation.add_turn("You are a funny person.", speaker=Speaker.SYSTEM)
conversation.add_turn("Hi, how are you?", speaker=Speaker.USER)
conversation.add_turn("I am doing well, how about you?", speaker=Speaker.AI)
conversation.add_turn("What are you planning to do today?", speaker=Speaker.USER)

list_models(type="chat")
['claude', 'claude-100k', 'claude-instant', 'claude-instant-100k', 'bard', 'koala-7b', 'koala-13b-v1', 'koala-13b-v2', 'vicuna-7b', 'vicuna-13b', 'alpaca-13b', 'chat-gpt', 'gpt4', 'gpt4-32k', 'stablelm-3b', 'stablelm-7b', 'palm']
gpt4 = get("gpt4", type="chat")
next_turn = gpt4(conversation)
print(next_turn)
```

For vision-augmented (image) engines, use `type="image"`
```python
import grazier
from PIL import Image

grazier.list_models(type="image")
['blip2-opt-2.7b', 'blip2-opt-6.7b', 'blip2-opt-2.7b-coco', 'blip2-opt-6.7b-coco', 'blip2-flan-t5-xl', 'blip2-flan-t5-xxl', 'blip2-flan-t5-xl-coco', 'openflamingo-3b-vitl-mpt1b', 'openflamingo-3b-vitl-mpt1b-dolly', 'openflamingo-9b-vitl-mpt7b', 'openflamingo-4b-vitl-rpj3b']
blip2 = grazier.get("blip2-opt-2.7b", type="image")

image = Image.open('test_data/dog.jpg')
completion = blip2(image, "A photo of")

print(completion)
```

## Individual Engine Setup

Each engine may require some specific details to be passed in. For example, OpenAI engines require an API key. These
details are generally set up with environment variables.

### OpenAI Engines

For OpenAI engines, you will need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_ORG` environment variables. You can find
your API key and organization ID on the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/). You can set these environment
variables in your shell or in a `.env` file in the root of your project. For example, in a `.env` file, you would have:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>
OPENAI_API_ORG=<your org id>
```
or on the command line:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>
export OPENAI_API_ORG=<your org id>
```

### Anthropic Engines
For Anthropic engines, you will need to set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable. You can find your API key at
the [Anthropic dashboard](https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys). You can set this environment variable in
your shell or in a `.env` file in the root of your project. For example, in a `.env` file, you would have:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your key>
```
or on the command line:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your key>
```

### Vertex Engines (PaLM)
For Google engines, we use the Vertex cloud API, which requires a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project. You can create a
GCP project at the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). You will also need to enable the Vertex AI API for
your project, set up a services account, and download the account JSON credentials. You can find instructions for that
following steps 1 to 6 of the tutorial  [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/tutorials/image-recognition-automl).
Finally, you will need to set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of the JSON file.
You can set this environment variable in your shell or in a `.env` file in the root of your project. For example, in a
`.env` file, you would have:
```bash
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path to your JSON file>
```
or on the command line:
```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path to your JSON file>
```

### Bard
For the Bard engine, you will need to get your Bard __Secure-1PSID and __Secure-1PSIDTS tokens.  Get the value of this
variable by first going to https://bard.google.com/, then log in, press F12 for console, and go to the "Application" tab,
then "Cookies", then copy the value of the "__Secure-1PSID" and "__Secure-1PSIDTS" cookies. You can then set the
environment variables:
```bash
BARD__Secure_1PSID=<your session id>
BARD__Secure_1PSIDTS=<your session id timestamp>
```

### Huggingface Engines
Most of the huggingface engines require no additional setup, however, some of the larger models require a GPU to run
with any kind of efficiency (and some require multiple GPUs with large amounts of memory). You can find more details
about the requirements for each model on the [Huggingface model hub](https://huggingface.co/models).

### Llama, Alpaca, Koala, Vicuna and AllenAI Engines
For these engines, you will need to obtain and postprocess the weights yourself (due to Facebook's licensing). You can
find the instructions for doing so on each model page:
- Llama: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama
- Alpaca: https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca#recovering-alpaca-weights
- Koala: https://github.com/young-geng/EasyLM/blob/main/docs/koala.md
- Vicuna: https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat#vicuna-weights
- AllenAI: https://huggingface.co/allenai/tulu-65b

Once the weights have been downloaded and processed, you can set the following environment variables to the root
directory containing a folder for each variant (The format is, `{root_dir}/{model-prefix}/weights.bin`, the root directory would
be `root_dir`, and the model-prefix is the name of the model, e.g. `tulu-65b`):
```bash
LLAMA_WEIGHTS_ROOT=<path to the llama weights>
ALPACA_WEIGHTS_ROOT=<path to the alpaca weights>
KOALA_WEIGHTS_ROOT=<path to the koala weights>
VICUNA_WEIGHTS_ROOT=<path to the vicuna weights>
ALLENAI_WEIGHTS_ROOT=<path to the allenai weights>
```

### AI21 Models (Jurassic)
For AI21 models, you will need to set the `AI21_API_KEY` environment variable. You can find your API key at
the [AI21 Studio Dashboard](https://studio.ai21.com/account/api-key). You can set this environment variable in
your shell or in a `.env` file in the root of your project. For example, in a `.env` file, you would have:
```bash
AI21_API_KEY=<your key>
```
or on the command line:
```bash
export AI21_API_KEY=<your key>
```
